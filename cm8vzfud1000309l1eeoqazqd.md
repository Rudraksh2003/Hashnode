### Vibe Coding: The Frustration of Newbie Engineers

With the rise of AI-powered coding tools, many junior and mid-level developers are asking, *Why should we even learn to code?* AI can generate entire applications from simple prompts, new compilers are constantly emerging, and every day we see new experiments with AI-powered development.

This has led to a growing frustration among newcomers to the field—why put in the effort to learn programming when AI can seemingly do it all? The industry is witnessing massive layoffs, and even I’m struggling to find a job (*joking but not really*). So, does this mean software engineers are becoming obsolete? Not quite.

### Why Do We Still Need Software Engineers?

Let’s say I use an AI tool to build a product with *vibe coding*—just describing what I want in natural language and letting AI handle the rest. It might work initially, but the real challenge begins when I put the product into production.

Now, I need to add new features or fix bugs. I turn to my AI tool and say, *“Hey AI, add this feature.”* But suddenly, I notice some parts of my codebase break. I try to fix those, and something else goes wrong. This is where the limits of AI become clear—while AI can generate code, it struggles with maintaining and evolving a complex system over time.

AI lacks true understanding. It doesn’t think critically, anticipate long-term architectural issues, or ensure software stability. This is why software engineers are still essential—we are not just code writers; we are **maintainers, problem solvers, and architects of scalable systems**.

### Are We Just Maintainers?

It’s easy to say that software engineers will just be reduced to maintainers, fixing AI-generated messes. But that’s not entirely true. The real risk is for developers who focus only on surface-level coding without understanding deeper system design principles.

A few years ago, Wix promised that people wouldn’t need developers to build websites. Yet, today, skilled frontend and backend engineers are still in high demand. Similarly, AI may automate coding tasks, but **understanding system design, choosing the right tools, and solving real-world problems require human expertise**.

### The Future of Software Engineers

So, what’s the future of software engineering? Should we be worried? **Not at all.**

When AI-powered coding becomes mainstream, it won’t eliminate software engineers—it will change our role. Instead of writing boilerplate code, we will focus on **high-level architecture, debugging AI-generated inefficiencies, and maintaining long-term software health**.

If any successful *vibe coding* product goes into production, there will inevitably be chaos. And when that happens, experienced software engineers will be needed to **untangle the mess, scale the product, and ensure reliability**.

The key is to evolve—**learn system design, AI-assisted development, and problem-solving skills.** The future belongs to engineers who **understand how to use AI as a tool rather than fear it**. Adapt, innovate, and thrive!
