When sitting in meetings with senior developers, it's easy to get lost in the technical terminology - API call rates, Redis optimisation strategies, and efficient coding patterns. While these discussions are critical for implementation, they often overshadow the fundamental sustainability questions that determine whether software survives and thrives in the real world.

Let's explore three essential aspects of software sustainability that go beyond pure technical implementation:

## Why You Need This Project

Every software project begins with identifying a problem, but the "how" is what truly matters. Understanding the specific pain points you're addressing and the unique approach your solution takes is crucial. A sustainable software solution doesn't just solve a problem technically - it solves it in a way that resonates with users and stands out from alternatives.

When evaluating project necessity, ask yourself:

* What specific friction does this eliminate for users?
    
* How is this approach different from existing solutions?
    
* Does it address a persistent need or a temporary one?
    

## Is the Project's Business Logic Great?

Even technically brilliant software needs a viable business model behind it. Consider how the project will generate value - whether through direct revenue, portfolio enhancement, or other means.

If you're building a portfolio piece, think about how it demonstrates your capabilities to potential clients. Can you showcase it as proof of your ability to build similar solutions for paying customers? If it's a product with users, what's your monetization strategy? Will you charge for premium features, implement a subscription model, or generate revenue through other means?

## Which Affordable Tech Should You Use?

This is where practicality meets sustainability. Using overly complex architecture for simple problems isn't just technically inefficient - it's financially unsustainable.

A calculator app doesn't need a microservices architecture running on EKS clusters that costs $5-7 daily in infrastructure fees. Starting with simpler, cost-effective technology stacks allows you to build sustainability into your project from day one.

If your user base grows or performance issues arise, you can always scale up or migrate to more robust technologies. The key is matching your technical approach to your actual needs rather than following trends or overengineering from the start.

The true art of software sustainability isn't just writing clean code or implementing the latest frameworks - it's making pragmatic decisions that balance technical excellence with business viability and cost-effectiveness. This balanced approach ensures your software can continue serving its purpose without becoming a resource drain.
