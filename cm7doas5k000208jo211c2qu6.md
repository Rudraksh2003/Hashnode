Yesterday, I came across a random joke on LinkedIn that made me realise something important. The joke explained how dirty code is only understandable by its author, making it irreplaceable. It got me thinking: what kind of bad coders still exist today? Because, in the current era, even junior developers write relatively clean code with the help of AI.

## The Role of AI in Coding

Before AI, coding was a craft mastered by problem solvers. Imagine a world without coders—impossible, right? But now, I foresee a future where I might not see coders at all, not because AI will replace them, but because many lack real problem-solving skills.

Take freshers like me, for example. Instead of enhancing our skills from scratch, we instinctively turn to AI for solutions. Need a frontend? Ask ChatGPT. Stuck on a problem? Ask ChatGPT. Many junior developers today believe AI makes coding replaceable, but that’s not AI’s fault—I blame the world, and I am part of the problem too.

## The Effect of AI Dependence

There’s a saying in Hindi: *“Directly Getting Prepared food is poison for your mind."* This resonates deeply with my journey. When I first started coding, I depended heavily on AI. But one of my mentors told me, “Sign out from ChatGPT and figure out how things work yourself.” So I did.

I struggled, visited 10+ Stack Overflow discussions, read multiple articles, and the outcome? I had started with a spoonful of knowledge but ended up with a bowl full of insights. Not only did I find the right solution, but my business logic and problem-solving skills also improved. Relying solely on one AI-generated response stops independent thinking and weakens your ability to debug complex issues.

One could argue, *“If I can get a solution easily, why should I work hard?”* But that’s exactly the problem—instant solutions make us mentally lazy and less adaptable.

## The Future Impact of AI on Developers

Many developers in the future will be easily replaceable—not because AI is taking their jobs, but because they lack deep technical skills. These are the types of developers who, after encountering one bug, use AI to fix it, only to create three more bugs in the process. Eventually, they become frustrated and say, *"AI will replace us."*

But here’s the reality: AI is a tool, not a replacement.

## How AI is Actually Useful

We are living in a golden era of development. A few years ago, if someone in a remote village wanted to learn coding, they had no expert mentors around to help. Today, AI acts as a knowledgeable buddy who provides instant feedback, explanations, and guidance for improvement.

The key is to use AI wisely. Don’t let it be your crutch—let it be your assistant. Use it to enhance your learning, not replace your efforts. The developers who succeed in the future will be those who combine AI’s efficiency with their own problem-solving mindset.

So, the question is—are you letting AI make you a better developer, or are you letting it turn you into a replaceable one?
