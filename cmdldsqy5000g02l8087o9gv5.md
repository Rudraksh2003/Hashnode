Hi, I’m Rudraksh. You probably forgot me on Hashnode, and I don’t blame you — I’ve been MIA for a while. But I’m back, and not just with another article — I’m back with a fire un

under my feet and a bullet aimed at myself. Metaphorically, of course.

Let me explain.

### The $10,000 Deadline

A month ago, I set myself a crazy challenge:  
**Earn $10,000 through freelancing or my own products before my birthday.**  
It sounded bold. Audacious. Visionary.  
But now, there are only **8 days left** — and I’ve earned nothing. I’m still unemployed. No freelance leads. Zero clients. The pressure is *real*.

And yes, maybe I shot myself with that target. But sometimes pressure is the only way we grow.

### Who Am I?

I’m a DevOps + MERN stack developer from India.  
I build real things. Not tutorial clones — I mean real projects that solve real problems.

I consult on projects from development to deployment. I’ve worked on CI/CD pipelines, UI libraries, file-sharing apps, payment systems — name it. But that’s not the highlight. Recently, I went all-in on two personal products:

---

### [🚀 **Virendana UI**](http://virendana.xyz/)

A beautiful UI component library, built with design precision.  
Today, it’s a component kit.  
Tomorrow, it’s your personal *developer friend* — helping you write better UIs, faster.

---

### [📘 **Learn Virendana**](http://learnvirendana.xyz/)

A no-nonsense platform to learn development the practical way.  
No clickbait. No fluff. Just raw, real-world content — the kind you wish you found when you started.

---

### What Went Wrong?

Even after building, writing, and grinding — I broke down.  
Instead of hunting clients, I overthought.  
Instead of marketing, I doubted.  
I let fear waste my time.

But fear won't pay the bills. And now, the countdown is real:

📅 **8 days**  
💸 **$10,000 goal**  
😵‍💫 **0 leads**  
🔥 **Infinite pressure**

And weirdly enough, this *impossible* goal is starting to fuel me.

---

### What’s Next?

I’m improving both my products — pushing updates, refining UX, rethinking positioning.  
But I’m also opening up. I’m no longer hiding behind perfection.  
I’m here to build *and* sell.  
I’m reaching out.  
If you need:

* A fullstack MVP
    
* DevOps help (Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, infra)
    
* Or even just honest consulting to validate your idea
    

👉 **I’m available. Right now.**

DM me on LinkedIn, reply here, or drop me a mail — I’ll respond.

### Why I'm Publishing This

Not for sympathy. Not for attention.  
But to **hold myself accountable.**  
To remind myself that if I miss this goal — I missed it because I hid when I should’ve shown up.  
This is me **showing up.**

$10,000 in 8 days?  
I don’t know if I’ll make it.

But I’d rather die trying than rot in regret.

**Let’s go. I’m ready.**
