In early June 2025, **KiranaPro**, a rising grocery-tech startup, faced a catastrophic event: **their EC2 servers were wiped out**. Initially assumed to be a cyberattack, it was later discovered that the source was an **internal threat — a disgruntled ex-employee**. This shocking incident is more than a headline — it's a **wake-up call** for anyone working in the cloud or DevOps space.

But what does a "data wipe" really mean, and how can you protect yourself from it?

---

### ⚠️ What Is a Data Wipe?

A **data wipe** is the complete and often irreversible deletion of data from servers, disks, or databases. In KiranaPro's case, **critical production EC2 instances were deleted**, which may have included configuration, customer data, and operational logic — essentially **bringing down core systems**.

### 🔍 The Real Lesson: Monitoring Isn’t Optional

If you're a beginner in DevOps or cloud architecture, you might think **“Monitoring is just optional.”**  
But **trust me — it’s a game-changer.**

Let me share my story.

---

### 🧾 My Story: The $15 Mistake

Last year, I spun up an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster for a project and enabled Prometheus monitoring. After my work, I **forgot to tear it down**.

Guess what happened next?

📩 I received an AWS bill for **$15** for unused resources still running in the background. It may not seem like a big amount, but it was a **painful lesson**.

If I had set up **CloudWatch alarms** or basic monitoring alerts, I could’ve shut it down in time — **saving money and peace of mind**.

### 🧰 Tools KiranaPro Could’ve Used (And So Can You)

If KiranaPro was using Kubernetes or modern cloud architecture, they could’ve benefited from:

* **Prometheus + Grafana** – For deep resource monitoring and metrics visualization
    
* **CloudWatch** – For real-time AWS resource alerts and logs
    
* **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – To track and analyze logs
    
* **Security tools like AWS GuardDuty or IAM anomaly detection** – To catch unauthorized or risky activity before it’s too late
    

Monitoring tools don’t prevent disasters, but they tell you **where your infrastructure is weak** and help you respond **before** it's too late.

### 🧯 Don’t Just Monitor — Plan for Disaster Recovery

Monitoring helps detect issues, but you should also **build for recovery**.

Here are two real-world projects I built for backup and disaster recovery:

* 📦 [**Kubernetes Dynamic Storage + MySQL Backup**](https://github.com/Rudraksh2003/kubernetes-dynamic-storage-mysql)  
    A plug-and-play setup to dynamically provision storage volumes in Kubernetes clusters, keeping persistent data safe.
    
* 🛡️ [**Postgres DB Backup with AWS + Terraform + Jenkins**](https://github.com/Rudraksh2003/aws-terraform-jenkins-postgres-db-backup.git)  
    A robust, production-grade solution for automatically backing up Postgres databases using CI/CD pipelines.

### 💡 Final Takeaway

The story of KiranaPro is not just about a data breach — it’s about the **importance of foresight**.

Whether you’re a solo developer, a startup founder, or a DevOps engineer:

> **Monitoring isn’t a feature. It’s a survival mechanism.**

Start small, monitor everything, automate backups, and plan for failure.

Because one small oversight could cost you more than just money — it could wipe out your entire business.
