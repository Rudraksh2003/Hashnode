Hi, I am Rudraksh.  
This is not a full-blown startup announcement but more of a **hypothetical concept** of how I can build a calendar scheduling app like [Cal.com](http://Cal.com), but at a much lower price. I am writing this to share my thought process, get feedback, and maybe inspire others. Of course, there will be **limitations in scalability and performance**, but that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî this is more of a ‚Äúhow I would design it‚Äù piece.

---

## What is [Cal.com](http://Cal.com)?

[Cal.com](http://Cal.com) is basically a platform where a client can **schedule a discovery call or one-to-one session** with you. It integrates with multiple calendars like Google or Outlook and helps avoid the back-and-forth of ‚ÄúWhen are you free?‚Äù

Now, instead of reinventing the wheel, I just thought ‚Äî why not make a **simplified version** for personal/freelance use where infra costs stay super low?

---

## My Tech Choices

I will go with **Node.js** for the backend because it‚Äôs fast, easy to use, and has a big ecosystem.

* **JWT authentication** ‚Üí for security and user sessions
    
* **MongoDB Atlas** ‚Üí to store user data (easy scaling + free tier works)
    
* **Redis** ‚Üí for caching and faster user experience
    
* **WebSockets** ‚Üí to push notifications (like reminders or updates) in real time
    

For hosting:

* **Backend on Render** (free/cheap tier works well)
    
* **Frontend on Vercel** (great for React and Next.js, also free tier friendly)
    

So infra is cheap, clean, and easy to maintain.

---

## How I Imagine the Flow

### 1\. First Page ‚Üí Platform Connect

When a new user signs up, the first page will ask: *Which platform do you want to connect with?* (Google, Outlook, or Zoom).  
This way, they directly sync calendars and conferencing tools.

### 2\. Dashboard ‚Üí Profile Setup

User sets up how their **public profile** should look (like ‚ÄúBook a call with Rudraksh‚Äù). They can choose availability, description, links, etc.

### 3\. Backend ‚Üí Data & Notes

Here comes the twist. Instead of storing only appointments, I also integrate:

* **Notion API** or **Google Docs API** ‚Üí to save client details automatically in bullet format
    
* This can be enhanced with **Gemini (AI premium feature)** to auto-summarize client info for freelancers
    

### 4\. Scheduling ‚Üí Calls & Payments

* The client picks a date ‚Üí app checks your calendar ‚Üí generates a **Google Meet link automatically**
    
* Notifications go through **WebSocket** (instant updates instead of email delays)
    
* If it‚Äôs a **paid discovery call**, then use **Stripe.js** or **Razorpay** for payment

## Cost Analysis

The main goal: **low infra burn**.  
For ~1000 active users, cost can be as low as **$0 ‚Äì $5** (thanks to free tiers):

* **MongoDB Atlas free tier**
    
* **Redis free plan**
    
* **Render + Vercel free/cheap tier**
    

So basically, the infra is close to **barely anything** compared to scaling [Cal.com](http://Cal.com). If one day usage grows massively, of course, infra costs will rise, but at small scale it‚Äôs super affordable.

---

## Why I Like This Idea

* Low infra ‚Üí doesn‚Äôt burn money unnecessarily
    
* Useful for **freelancers, creators, or coaches** who just want simple scheduling + payments
    
* Extensible ‚Üí can add AI summaries, more calendar integrations, or even analytics later
    

This is just a **raw design thought**. I haven‚Äôt built it fully yet, but the concept excites me because it mixes practicality (scheduling, payments) with low infra cost (almost free hosting).

---

## Closing Thoughts

This is not about competing with [Cal.com](http://Cal.com), but showing how you can design a **lean version** of the same idea, especially useful if you‚Äôre a freelancer or small business who doesn‚Äôt want to spend much on infra.

If you have thoughts, improvements, or want to collaborate, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. üöÄ
